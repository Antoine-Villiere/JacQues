## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Warning
Please be aware that JacQues, like all AI systems, has limitations:

- **Potential Inaccuracie**s: JacQues may sometimes provide inaccurate or incorrect information. Always verify critical information from reliable sources.
- **No Fact-Checking**: The system does not have built-in fact-checking capabilities. Use your judgment when interpreting responses.
- **Limited Context**: While JacQues attempts to maintain context, it may not always fully understand the nuances of complex queries or situations.
- **Evolving Technology**: As an open-source project, JacQues is continuously evolving. Features and capabilities may change over time.
- **Not for Critical Decisions**: Do not rely solely on JacQues for making important decisions, especially in areas like health, finance, or legal matters.
- **Do not share sensitive information**: While no information is shared with the owner of the project, the use of external services necessary for the good work of the AI (Groq, LlamaParse, and Brave) makes it recommended not to share any sensitive information.
