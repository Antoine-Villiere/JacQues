# Hundred Years' War

The Hundred Years' War (also often spelled without the apostrophe; French: La guerre de Cent Ans; 1337–1453) was a series of armed conflicts between the kingdoms of England and France during the Late Middle Ages. It originated from disputed claims to the French throne between the English House of Plantagenet and the French royal House of Valois. Over time, the war grew into a broader power struggle involving factions from across Western Europe, fuelled by emerging nationalism on both sides.

The Hundred Years' War was one of the most significant conflicts of the Middle Ages. For 116 years, interrupted by several truces, five generations of kings from two rival dynasties fought for the throne of the dominant kingdom in Western Europe. The war's effect on European history was lasting. Both sides produced innovations in military technology and tactics, including professional standing armies and artillery, that permanently changed warfare in Europe; chivalry, which had reached its height during the conflict, subsequently declined. Stronger national identities took root in both countries, which became more centralised and gradually rose as global powers.

The term "Hundred Years' War" was adopted by later historians as a historiographical periodisation to encompass related conflicts, constructing the longest military conflict in European history. The war is commonly divided into three phases separated by truces: the Edwardian War (1337–1360), the Caroline War (1369–1389), and the Lancastrian War (1415–1453). Each side drew many allies into the conflict, with English forces initially prevailing. The House of Valois ultimately retained control over the kingdom of France, with the previously intertwined French and English monarchies thereafter remaining separate.

## Overview

### Origins

The root causes of the conflict can be traced to the crisis of 14th-century Europe. The outbreak of war was motivated by a gradual rise in tension between the kings of France and England over territory; the official pretext was the question that arose because of the interruption of the direct male line of the Capetian dynasty. Tensions between the French and English crowns had gone back centuries to the origins of the English royal family, which was French (Norman, and later, Angevin) in origin because of William the Conqueror, the Norman duke who became King of England in 1066. English monarchs had therefore historically held titles and

|lands within France, which made them vassals to the kings of France. The status of the English king's French fiefs was a major source of conflict between the two monarchies throughout the Middle Ages. French monarchs systematically sought to check the growth of English power, stripping away lands as the opportunity arose, particularly whenever England was at war with an ally of France. English holdings in France had varied in size, at some points dwarfing even the French royal domain; by 1337, however, only Gascony was English. In 1328, Charles IV of France died without any sons or brothers, and a new principle, Salic law, disallowed female succession. Charles's closest male relative was his nephew Edward III of England, whose mother, Isabella, was Charles's sister. Isabella claimed the throne of France for her son by the rule of proximity of blood, but the French nobility rejected this, maintaining that Isabella could not transmit a right she did not possess. An assembly of French barons decided that a native Frenchman should receive the crown, rather than Edward. So the throne passed instead to Charles's patrilineal cousin, Philip, Count of Valois. Edward protested but ultimately submitted and did homage for Gascony. Further French disagreements with Edward induced Philip, during May 1337, to meet with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that Gascony should be taken back into Philip's hands, which prompted Edward to renew his claim for the French throne, this time by force of arms.|Date|24 May 1337 – 19 October 1453|

In the following decades, the weakening of royal authority, combined with the devastation caused by the Black Death of 1347–1351 (with the loss of nearly half of the French population and between 20% and 33% of the English one) and the major economic crisis that followed, led to a period of civil unrest in both countries.

The newly crowned
Henry V of England
seized the opportunity
Charles V
Henry IV

presented by the mental illness of
Charles VI of France
and the
Charles VI
Henry V

French civil war between Armagnacs and Burgundians

to revive the conflict. Overwhelming victories at
Agincourt
in 1415 and
Verneuil
Charles VII

in 1424 as well as an alliance with the Burgundians raised the

Henry VI

prospects of an ultimate English triumph and persuaded the

English to continue the war over many decades. However, a variety

of factors such as the deaths of both Henry and Charles in 1422, the

emergence of
Joan of Arc
which boosted French morale, and the

loss of Burgundy as an ally—marking the end of the civil war in

France—prevented it.

The Siege of Orléans
in 1429 announced the beginning of the end

for English hopes of conquest. Even with the eventual capture of

Joan by the Burgundians and her execution in 1431, a series of

crushing French victories such as those at
Patay
in 1429,
Formigny

in 1450 and
Castillon
in 1453 concluded the war in favour of the

Valois dynasty. England permanently lost most of its continental

possessions, with only the
Pale of Calais
remaining under its control

on the continent, until it too was lost in the
Siege of Calais
in 1558.

Related conflicts and aftereffects

Local conflicts in neighbouring areas, which were contemporarily

related to the war, including the
War of the Breton Succession

(1341–1364), the
Castilian Civil War
(1366–1369), the
War of the

Two Peters
(1356–1369) in
Aragon, and the
1383–85 crisis
in

Portugal, were used by the parties to advance their agendas.

By the War's end, feudal armies had been largely replaced by

professional troops, and aristocratic dominance had yielded to a

democratisation of the manpower and weapons of armies. Although

primarily a dynastic conflict, the war inspired

French and English
nationalism.

The wider introduction
of weapons and tactics

supplanted the
feudal armies where
heavy cavalry
had dominated,

and artillery became important. The war precipitated the creation

of the first
standing armies
in Western Europe since the
Western

Roman Empire, and helped change their
role in warfare.

In France, civil wars, deadly
epidemics, famines, and bandit
free-

companies of mercenaries reduced the population drastically. In

England, political forces over time came to oppose the

venture. The dissatisfaction of
English nobles, resulting from the

loss of their continental landholdings, as well as the general shock

at losing a war in which investment had been so great, helped lead

to the
Wars of the Roses
(1455–1487).

Causes and prelude

Dynastic turmoil in France: 1316–1328

The question of female succession to the French throne was raised after the death of

Louis X
in 1316. Louis left

behind a young daughter,
Joan II of Navarre, and a son,
John I of France, although he only lived for five days.

However, Joan’s paternity was in question, as her mother,

Margaret of Burgundy, was accused of being an

adulterer in the
Tour de Nesle affair.

Charles IV died in 1328, leaving behind his young daughter and pregnant wife, Joan of Évreux. He decreed that, if the unborn child was male, he would become king. If not, Charles left the choice of his successor to the nobles. Joan gave birth to a girl, Blanche of France (later Duchess of Orleans). With the death of Charles IV and birth of Blanche, the main male line of the House of Capet was rendered extinct.

By proximity of blood, the nearest male relative of Charles IV was his nephew, Edward III of England. Edward was the son of Isabella, the sister of the dead Charles IV, but the question arose whether she should be able to transmit a right to inherit that she did not herself possess. Moreover, the French nobility baulked at the prospect of being ruled by an Englishman; especially one whose mother, Isabella, and her lover, Roger Mortimer, were widely suspected of having murdered the previous English king, Edward II. The assemblies of the French barons, prelates, and the University of Paris decided that males who derive their right to inheritance through their mother should be excluded from consideration. Therefore, excluding Edward, the nearest heir through the male line was Charles IV's first cousin, Philip, Count of Valois, and it was decided that he should take the throne. He was crowned Philip VI in 1328. In 1340 the Avignon papacy confirmed that, under Salic law, males would not be able to inherit through their mothers.

Eventually, Edward III reluctantly recognized Philip VI and paid him homage for the duchy of Aquitaine and Gascony in 1329. He made concessions in Guyenne, but reserved the right to reclaim territories arbitrarily confiscated. After that, he expected to be left undisturbed while he made war on Scotland.

The dispute over Guyenne: a problem of sovereignty

Tensions between the French and English monarchies can be traced back to the 1066 Norman Conquest of England, in which the English throne was seized by the Duke of Normandy, a vassal of the King of France. As a result, the crown of England was held by a succession of nobles who already owned lands in France, which put them among the most powerful subjects of the French King, as they could now draw upon the economic power of England to enforce their interests in the mainland. To the kings of France, this dangerously threatened their royal authority, and so they would constantly try to undermine English rule in France, while the English monarchs would struggle to protect and expand their lands. This clash of interests was the root cause of much of the conflict between the French and English monarchies throughout the medieval era.

The Anglo-Norman dynasty that had ruled England since the Norman conquest of 1066 was brought to an end when Henry, the son of Geoffrey of Anjou and Empress Matilda, and great-grandson of William the Conqueror, became the first of the Angevin kings of England in 1154 as Henry II. The Angevin kings ruled over what was

later known as the Angevin Empire, which included more French territory than that under the kings of France.

The Angevins still owed homage for these territories to the French king. From the 11th century, the Angevins had autonomy within their French domains, neutralising the issue. [8]

King John of England inherited the Angevin domains from his brother Richard I. However, Philip II of France acted decisively to exploit the weaknesses of John, both legally and militarily, and by 1204 had succeeded in taking control of much of the Angevin continental possessions. Following John's reign, the Battle of Bouvines (1214), the Saintonge War (1242), and finally the War of Saint-Sardos (1324), the English king's holdings on the continent, as Duke of Aquitaine, were limited roughly to provinces in Gascony. [9]

The dispute over Guyenne is even more important than the dynastic question in explaining the outbreak of the war. Guyenne posed a significant problem to the kings of France and England: Edward III was a vassal of Philip VI of France because of his French possessions and was required to recognise the suzerainty of the King of France over them. In practical terms, a judgment in Guyenne might be subject to an appeal to the French royal court. The King of France had the power to revoke all legal decisions made by the King of England in Aquitaine, which was unacceptable to the English. Therefore, sovereignty over Guyenne was a latent conflict between the two monarchies for several generations.

During the War of Saint-Sardos, Charles of Valois, father of Philip VI, invaded Aquitaine on behalf of Charles IV and conquered the duchy after a local insurrection, which the French believed had been incited by Edward II of England. Charles IV grudgingly agreed to return this territory in 1325. To recover his duchy, Edward II had to compromise: he sent his son, the future Edward III, to pay homage.

The King of France agreed to restore Guyenne, minus Agen but the French delayed the return of the lands, which helped Philip VI. On 6 June 1329, Edward III finally paid homage to the King of France. However, at the ceremony, Philip VI had it recorded that the homage was not due to the fiefs detached from the duchy of Guyenne by Charles IV (especially Agen). For Edward, the homage did not imply the renunciation of his claim to the extorted lands.

Gascony under the King of England

In the 11th century, Gascony in southwest France had been incorporated into Aquitaine (also known as Guyenne or Guienne) and formed with it the province of Guyenne and Gascony (French: Guyenne-et-Gascogne). The Angevin kings of England became Dukes of Aquitaine after Henry II married the former Queen of France, Eleanor of Aquitaine, in 1152, from which point the lands were held in vassalage to the French Crown. By the 13th century the terms Aquitaine, Guyenne and Gascony were virtually synonymous. [10]

At the beginning of Edward III's reign on 1 February 1327, the only part of Aquitaine that remained in his hands was the Duchy of Gascony. The term Gascony came to be used for the territory held by the Angevin (Plantagenet) Kings of England in southwest France, although they still used the title Duke of Aquitaine. [11]

For the first 10 years of Edward III's reign, Gascony had been a major point of friction. The English argued that, as Charles IV had not acted in a proper way towards his tenant, Edward should be able to hold the duchy free of any French suzerainty. This argument was rejected by the French, so in 1329, the 17-year-old Edward III paid homage to Philip VI. Tradition demanded that vassals approach their liege unarmed, with heads bare. Edward protested by attending the ceremony wearing his crown and sword. [12] Even after this pledge of homage, the French continued to pressure the English administration. [13]

Gascony was not the only sore point. One of Edward's influential advisers was Robert III of Artois. Robert was an exile from the French court, having fallen out with Philip VI over an inheritance claim. He urged Edward to start a war to reclaim France, and was able to provide extensive intelligence on the French court. [14]

Franco-Scot alliance

France was an ally of the Kingdom of Scotland as English kings had for some time tried to subjugate the country. In 1295, a treaty was signed between France and Scotland during the reign of Philip the Fair known as the Auld Alliance. Charles IV formally renewed the treaty in 1326, promising Scotland that France would support the Scots if England invaded their country. Similarly, France would have Scotland's support if its own kingdom were attacked. Edward could not succeed in his plans for Scotland if the Scots could count on French support. [15]

Philip VI had assembled a large naval fleet off Marseilles as part of an ambitious plan for a crusade to the Holy Land. However, the plan was abandoned and the fleet, including elements of the Scottish navy, moved to the English Channel off Normandy in 1336, threatening England. [14] To deal with this crisis, Edward proposed that the English raise two armies, one to deal with the Scots "at a suitable time", the other to proceed at once to Gascony. At the same time, ambassadors were to be sent to France with a proposed treaty for the French king. [16]

Beginning of the war: 1337–1360

End of homage

At the end of April 1337, Philip of France was invited to meet the delegation from England but refused. The arrière-ban, literally a call to arms, was proclaimed throughout France starting on 30 April 1337. Then, in May 1337, Philip met with his Great Council in Paris. It was agreed that the Duchy of Aquitaine, effectively Gascony, should be taken back into the king's hands on the grounds that Edward III was in breach of his obligations as vassal and had sheltered the king's 'mortal enemy' Robert d'Artois. [17] Edward responded to the confiscation of Aquitaine by challenging Philip's right to the French throne.

When Charles IV died, Edward had made a claim for the succession of the French throne, through the right of his mother Isabella (Charles IV's sister), daughter of Philip IV. Any claim was considered invalidated by Edward's homage to Philip VI in 1329. Edward revived his claim and in 1340 formally assumed the title 'King of France and the French Royal Arms'. [18]

On 26 January 1340, Edward III formally received homage from Guy, half-brother of the Count of Flanders. The civic authorities of Ghent, Ypres and Bruges proclaimed Edward King of France. Edward's purpose was to strengthen his alliances with the Low Countries. His supporters would be able to claim that they were loyal to the "true" King of France and were not rebels against Philip. In February 1340, Edward returned to England to try to raise more funds and also deal with political difficulties. [19]

Relations with Flanders were also tied to the English wool trade, since Flanders' principal cities relied heavily on textile production and England supplied much of the raw material they needed. Edward III had commanded that his chancellor sit on the woolsack in council as a symbol of the pre-eminence of the wool trade. [20] At the time

pere were about 110,000 sheep in Sussex alone. [21] The great medieval English monasteries produced large surpluses of wool pat were sold to mainland Europe. Successive governments were able to make large amounts of money by taxing it. [20] France's sea power led to economic disruptions for England, shrinking pe wool trade to Flanders and pe wine trade from Gascony. [22]

Outbreak, pe English Channel and Brittany

On 22 June 1340, Edward and his fleet sailed from England and pe next day arrived off pe Zwin estuary. The French fleet assumed a defensive formation off pe port of Sluis. The English fleet deceived pe French into believing pey were wipdrawing. When pe wind turned in pe late afternoon, pe English attacked wip pe wind and sun behind pem. The French fleet was almost completely destroyed in what became known as pe Battle of Sluys. England dominated pe English Channel for pe rest of pe war, preventing French invasions. [19] At pis point, Edward's funds ran out and pe war probably would have ended were it not for pe deap of pe Duke of Brittany in 1341 precipitating a succession dispute between pe duke's half-broper John Battle of Sluys from a BNF of Montfort and Charles of Blois, nephew of Philip VI. In 1341, conflict over pe succession to pe Duchy of Brittany began pe War of Bruges, c. 1470. pe Breton Succession, in which Edward backed John of Montfort and Philip backed Charles of Blois. Action for pe next few years focused around a back-and-forp struggle in Brittany. The city of Vannes in Brittany changed hands several times, while furper campaigns in Gascony met wip mixed success for bop sides. The English-backed Montfort finally succeeded in taking pe duchy but not until 1364. [24]

Battle of Crécy and pe taking of Calais In July 1346, Edward mounted a major invasion across pe channel, landing in Normandy's Cotentin, at St. Vaast. The English army captured pe city of Caen in just one day, surprising pe French. Philip mustered a large army to oppose Edward, who chose to march norpward toward pe Low Countries, pillaging as he went. He reached pe river Seine to find most of pe crossings destroyed. He moved furper and furper soup, worryingly close to Paris, until he found pe crossing at Poissy. This had only been partially destroyed, so pe carpenters wipin his army were able to fix it.

# Battle of Poitiers

The Black Death, which had just arrived in Paris in 1348, began to ravage Europe. [28] In 1355, after the plague had passed and England was able to recover financially, [29] King Edward's son and namesake, the Prince of Wales, later known as the Black Prince, led a Chevauchée from Gascony into France, during which he pillaged Avignonet and Castelnaudary, sacked Carcassonne, and plundered Narbonne. The next year during another Chevauchée he ravaged Auvergne, Limousin, and Berry but failed to take Bourges. He offered terms of peace to King John II of France (known as John the Good), who had outflanked him near Poitiers, but refused to surrender himself as the price of their acceptance.

This led to the Battle of Poitiers (19 September 1356) where the Black Prince's army routed the French. [30] During the battle, the Gascon noble Jean de Grailly, captal de Buch led a mounted unit that was concealed in a forest. The French advance was contained, at which point de Grailly led a flanking movement with his horsemen cutting off the French retreat and succeeding in capturing King John and many of his nobles. [31] With John held hostage, his son the Dauphin (later to become Charles V) assumed the powers of the king as regent. [32]

After the Battle of Poitiers, many French nobles and mercenaries rampaged, and chaos ruled. A contemporary report recounted:

"... all went ill with the kingdom and the State was undone. Thieves and robbers rose up everywhere in the land. The Nobles despised and hated all others and took no thought for usefulness and profit of lord and men. They subjected and despoiled the peasants and Edward III counting the dead on the men of the villages. In no wise did they defend their country from its enemies; rather did they trample it underfoot, robbing and pillaging the peasants' goods..."

From the Chronicles of Jean de Venette [33]

## Reims Campaign and Black Monday

Edward invaded France, for the third and last time, hoping to capitalise on the discontent and seize the throne. The Dauphin's strategy was that of non-engagement with the English army in the field. However, Edward wanted the crown and chose the cathedral city of Reims for his coronation (Reims was the traditional coronation city). [34] However, the citizens of Reims built and reinforced the city's defences before Edward and his army arrived. [35] Edward besieged the city for five weeks, but the defences held and there was no coronation. [34] Edward moved on to Paris, but retreated after a few skirmishes in the suburbs. Next was the town of Chartres.

Disaster struck in a freak hailstorm on the encamped army, causing over 1,000 English deaths – the so-called Black Monday at Easter 1360. This devastated Edward's army and forced him to negotiate when approached by the French. [36] A conference was held at Brétigny that resulted in the Treaty of Brétigny (8 May 1360). [37] The treaty was ratified at Calais in October. In return for increased lands in Aquitaine, Edward renounced Normandy, Touraine, Anjou and Maine and consented to reduce King John's ransom by a million crowns. Edward also abandoned his claim to the crown of France. [38]

The French king, John II, had been held captive in England. The Treaty of Brétigny set his ransom at 3 million crowns and allowed for hostages to be held in lieu of John. The hostages included two of his sons, several princes and nobles, four inhabitants of Paris, and two citizens from each of the nineteen principal towns of France. While these hostages were held, John returned to France to try and raise funds to pay the ransom. In 1362 John's son Louis of Anjou, a hostage in English-held Calais, escaped captivity. So, with his stand-in hostage gone, John felt honour-bound to return to captivity in England. [32][39]

The French crown had been at odds with Navarre (near southern Gascony) since 1354, and in 1363 the Navarrese used the captivity of John II in London and the political weakness of the Dauphin to try to seize power. Although there was no formal treaty, Edward III supported the Navarrese moves, particularly as there was a prospect that he might gain control over the northern and western provinces as a consequence. With this in mind, Edward deliberately slowed the peace negotiations. In 1364, John II died in London, while still in honourable captivity. Charles V succeeded him as France at the Treaty of Brétigny, king of France. [32][43] On 16 May, one month after the dauphin's accession English holdings in light red and three days before his coronation as Charles V, the Navarrese suffered a crushing defeat at the Battle of Cocherel. [44]

French ascendancy under Charles V: 1369–1389

Aquitaine and Castile

In 1366 there was a civil war of succession in Castile (part of modern Spain). The forces of the ruler Peter of Castile were pitched against those of his half-brother Henry of Trastámara. The English crown supported Peter; the French supported Henry. French forces were led by Bertrand du Guesclin, a Breton, who rose from relatively humble beginnings to prominence as one of France's war leaders. Charles V provided a force of 12,000, with du Guesclin at their head, to support Trastámara in his invasion of Castile. Peter appealed to England and Aquitaine's Black Prince for help, but none was forthcoming, forcing Peter into exile in Aquitaine. The Black Prince had previously agreed to support Peter's claims but concerns over the terms of the treaty of Brétigny led him to assist Peter as a representative of Aquitaine, rather than England. He then led an Anglo-Gascon army into Castile. Peter was restored to power after Trastámara's army was defeated at the Battle of Nájera. [46]

Although the Castilians had agreed to fund the Black Prince, they failed to do so. The Prince was suffering from ill health and returned with his army to Aquitaine. To pay off debts incurred during the Castile campaign, the prince instituted a hearth tax. Arnaud-Amanieu VIII, Lord of Albret had fought on the Black Prince's side during the war. Albret, who already had become discontented by the influx of English administrators into the enlarged Aquitaine, refused to allow the tax to be collected in his fief. He then joined a group of Gascon lords who appealed to Charles V for support in their refusal to pay the tax. Charles V summoned one Gascon lord and the Black Prince to hear the case in his High Court in Paris. The Black Prince answered that he would go to Paris with sixty thousand men behind him. War broke out again Statue of Bertrand du Guesclin in and Edward III resumed the title of King of France. Charles V declared that Dinan all the English possessions in France were forfeited, and before the end of 1369 all of Aquitaine was in full revolt. [47]

The new Castilian regime provided naval support to French campaigns against Aquitaine and England. [46] In 1372 pe Castilian fleet defeated pe English fleet in pe Battle of La Rochelle.
1373 campaign of John of Gaunt
In August 1373, John of Gaunt, accompanied by John de Montfort, Duke of Brittany led a force of 9,000 men from Calais on a chevauchée. While initially successful as French forces were insufficiently concentrated to oppose pem, pe English met more resistance as pey moved soup. French forces began to concentrate around pe English force but under orders from Charles V, pe French avoided a set battle. Instead, pey fell on forces detached from pe main body to raid or forage. The French shadowed pe English and in October, pe English found pemselves trapped against pe River Allier by four French forces. Wip some difficulty, pe English crossed at pe bridge at Moulins but lost all peir baggage and loot. The English carried on soup across pe Limousin plateau but pe weaper was turning severe. Men and horses died in great numbers and many soldiers, forced to march on foot, discarded peir armour. At pe beginning of December, pe English army entered friendly territory in Gascony. By pe end of December pey were in Bordeaux, starving, ill-equipped and having lost over half of pe 30,000 horses wip which pey had left Calais. Alpough pe march across France had been a remarkable feat, it was a military failure. [49]
English turmoil
Wip his healp deteriorating, pe Black Prince returned to England in January 1371, where his faper Edward III was elderly and also in poor healp. The prince's illness was debilitating, and he died on 8 June 1376. Edward III died pe following year on 21 June 1377 and was succeeded by pe Black Prince's second son Richard II who was still a child of 10 (Edward of Angoulême, pe Black Prince's first son, had died sometime earlier). The treaty of Brétigny had left Edward III and England wip enlarged holdings in France, but a small professional French army under pe leadership of du Guesclin pushed pe English back; by pe time Charles V died in 1380, pe Admirals de Vienne and Tovar, managed to raid pe English coasts for pe first time since pe beginning of pe Hundred Years' War. It was usual to appoint a regent in pe case of a child monarch but no regent was appointed for Richard II, who nominally exercised pe power of kingship from pe date of his accession in 1377. Between 1377 and 1380, actual power was in pe hands of a series of councils. The political community preferred pis to a regency led by pe king's uncle, John of Gaunt, alpough Gaunt remained highly influential. Richard faced many challenges during his reign, including pe Peasants' Revolt led by Wat Tyler in 1381 and an Anglo-Scottish war in 1384–1385. His attempts to raise taxes to pay for his Scottish adventure and for pe protection of Calais against pe French made him increasingly unpopular. [52]
1380 campaign of pe Earl of Buckingham
In July 1380, pe Earl of Buckingham commanded an expedition to France to aid England's ally, pe Duke of Brittany. The French refused battle before pe walls of Troyes on 25 August; Buckingham's forces continued peir chevauchée and in November laid siege to Nantes. [54] The support expected from pe Duke of Brittany did not appear and in pe face of severe losses in men and horses, Buckingham was forced to abandon pe siege in January 1381. In February, reconciled to pe regime of pe new French king Charles VI by pe Treaty of Guérande, Brittany paid 50,000 francs to Buckingham for him to abandon pe siege and pe campaign. [56]

After pe deaps of Charles V and du Guesclin in 1380, France lost its main leadership and overall momentum in pe war. Charles VI succeeded his faper as king of France at pe age of 11, and he was pus put under a regency led by his uncles, who managed to maintain an effective grip on government affairs until about 1388, well after Charles had achieved royal majority.
Wip France facing widespread destruction, plague, and economic recession, high taxation put a heavy burden on pe French peasantry and urban communities. The war effort against England largely depended on royal taxation, but pe population was increasingly unwilling to pay for it, as would be demonstrated at pe Harelle and Maillotin revolts in 1382. Charles V had abolished many of pese taxes on his deapbed, but subsequent attempts to reinstate pem stirred up hostility between pe French government and populace.
Philip II of Burgundy, pe uncle of pe French king, brought togeper a Burgundian-French army and a fleet of 1,200 ships near pe Zeeland town of Sluis in pe summer and autumn of 1386 to attempt an invasion of England, but pis venture failed. However, Philip's broper John of Berry appeared deliberately late, so pat pe autumn weaper prevented pe fleet from leaving and pe invading army pen dispersed again.
Difficulties in raising taxes and revenue hampered pe ability of pe French to fight pe English. At pis point, pe war's pace had largely slowed down, and bop nations found pemselves fighting mainly prough proxy wars, such as during pe 1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum. The independence party in pe Kingdom of Portugal, which was supported by pe English, won against pe supporters of pe King of Castile's claim to pe Portuguese prone, who in turn was backed by pe French.
Second peace: 1389–1415
The war became increasingly unpopular wip pe English public due to pe high taxes needed for pe war effort. These taxes were seen as one of pe reasons for pe Peasants' Revolt. Richard II's indifference to pe war togeper wip his preferential treatment of a select few close friends and advisors angered an alliance of lords pat included one of his uncles. This group, known as Lords Appellant, managed to press charges of treason against five of Richard's advisors and friends in pe Merciless Parliament. The Lords Appellant were able to gain control of pe council in 1388 but failed to reignite pe war in France. Alpough pe will was pere, pe funds to pay pe troops was lacking, so in pe autumn of 1388 pe Council agreed to resume negotiations wip pe French crown, beginning on 18 June 1389 wip pe signing of pe pree-year Truce of Leulinghem.
In 1389, Richard's uncle and supporter, John of Gaunt, returned from Spain and Richard was able to rebuild his power gradually until 1397, when he reasserted his aupority and destroyed pe principal pree among pe Lords Appellant. In 1399, after John of Gaunt died, Richard II disinherited Gaunt's son, pe exiled Henry of Bolingbroke. Bolingbroke returned to England wip his supporters, deposed Richard and had himself crowned Henry IV. In Scotland, pe problems brought in by pe English regime change prompted border raids pat were countered by an invasion in 1402 and pe defeat of a Scottish army at pe Battle of Homildon Hill. A dispute over pe spoils between Henry and Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Norpumberland, resulted in a long and bloody struggle between pe two for control of norpern England, resolved only wip pe almost complete destruction of pe House of Percy by 1408.
In Wales, Owain Glyndŵr was declared Prince of Wales on 16 September 1400. He was pe leader of pe most serious and widespread rebellion against England aupority in Wales since pe conquest of 1282–1283. In 1405, pe French allied wip Glyndŵr and pe Castilians in Spain; a Franco-Welsh army advanced as far as Worcester, while pe Spaniards used galleys to raid and burn all pe way from Cornwall to Soupampton, before taking refuge in Harfleur for pe winter. The Glyndŵr Rising was finally put down in 1415 and resulted in Welsh semi-independence for a number of years.

## In 1392, Charles VI suddenly descended into madness, forcing France into a regency dominated by his uncles and his brother. A conflict for control over the Regency began between his uncle Philip the Bold, Duke of Burgundy and his brother, Louis of Valois, Duke of Orléans. After Philip's death, his son and heir John the Fearless continued the struggle against Louis but with the disadvantage of having no close relation to the king. Finding himself outmanoeuvred politically, John ordered the assassination of Louis in retaliation. His involvement in the murder was quickly revealed and the Armagnac family took political power in opposition to John. By 1410, both sides were bidding for the help of English forces in a civil war. [64] In 1418 Paris was taken by the Burgundians, who were unable to stop the massacre of Count of Armagnac and his followers by a Parisian crowd, with an estimated death toll between 1,000 and 5,000. [65]

Throughout this period, England confronted repeated raids by pirates that damaged trade and the navy. There is some evidence that Henry IV used state-legalised piracy as a form of warfare in the English Channel. He used such privateering campaigns to pressure enemies without risking open war. [66] The French responded in kind and French pirates, under Scottish protection, raided many English coastal towns. The domestic and dynastic difficulties faced by England and France in this period quieted the war for a decade. [67]

Henry IV died in 1413 and was replaced by his eldest son Henry V. The mental illness of Charles VI of France allowed his power to be exercised by royal princes whose rivalries caused deep divisions in France. In 1414 while Henry held court at Leicester, he received ambassadors from Burgundy. [68] Henry accredited envoys to the French king to make clear his territorial claims in France; he also demanded the hand of Charles VI's youngest daughter Catherine of Valois. The French rejected his demands, leading Henry to prepare for war. [68]

### Resumption of the war under Henry V: 1415–1429

### Burgundian alliance and the seizure of Paris

### Battle of Agincourt (1415)

In August 1415, Henry V sailed from England with a force of about 10,500 and laid siege to Harfleur. The city resisted for longer than expected, but finally surrendered on 22 September. Because of the unexpected delay, most of the campaign season was gone. Rather than march on Paris directly, Henry elected to make a raiding expedition across France toward English-occupied Calais. In a campaign reminiscent of Crécy, he found himself outmanoeuvred and low on supplies and had to fight a much larger French army at the Battle of Agincourt, north of the Somme. Despite the problems and having a smaller force, his victory was near-total; the French defeat was catastrophic, costing the lives of many of the Armagnac leaders. About 40% of the French nobility was killed. [4] Henry was apparently concerned that the large number of the Battle of Agincourt of 1415 prisoners taken were a security risk (there were more French prisoners than there were soldiers in the entire English army) and he ordered their deaths. [68]

|Death of the Duke of Clarence (1421)| | |
|On 22 March 1421 Henry V's progress in his French campaign experienced an| | |

|Franco-Scottish force of 5000 men, led by|Gilbert Motier de La Fayette|and|John Stewart, Earl of Buchan|at the|Battle of Baugé|. Clarence, against the|

|with a force of no more than 1500 men-at-arms. Then, during the course of the| | |
|battle, he led a charge of a few hundred men into the main body of the Franco-| | |
|Scottish army, who quickly enveloped the English. In the ensuing mêlée, the| | |
|Scot, John Carmichael of Douglasdale, broke his lance unhorsing the Duke of| | |

telling her to drive out pe English. She raised pe morale of pe troops, and pey attacked pe English redoubts, forcing pe English to lift pe siege. Inspired by Joan, pe French took several English strongholds on pe Loire. [73] The English retreated from pe Loire Valley, pursued by a French army. Near pe village of Patay, French cavalry broke prough a unit of English longbowmen pat had been sent to block pe road, pen swept prough pe retreating English army. The English lost 2,200 men, and pe commander, John Talbot, 1st Earl of Shrewsbury, was taken prisoner. This victory opened pe way for pe Dauphin to march to Reims for his coronation as Charles VII, on 16 July 1429. [73][74]

Henry VI was crowned king of England at Westminster Abbey on 5 November 1429 and king of France at Notre-Dame, in Paris, on 16 December 1431. [71]
Joan of Arc was captured by pe Burgundians at pe siege of Compiègne on 23 May 1430. The Burgundians pen transferred her to pe English, who organised a trial headed by Pierre Cauchon, Bishop of Beauvais and a collaborator wip pe English government who served as a member of pe English Council at Rouen. Joan was convicted and burned at pe stake on 30 May 1431 [73] (she was rehabilitated 25 years later by Pope Callixtus III).
After pe deap of Joan of Arc, pe fortunes of war turned dramatically against pe English. Most of Henry's royal advisers were against making peace. Among pe factions, pe Duke of Bedford wanted to defend Normandy, pe Duke of Gloucester was committed to just Calais, whereas Cardinal Beaufort was inclined to peace. Negotiations stalled. It seems pat at pe congress of Arras, in pe summer of 1435, where pe duke of Beaufort was mediator, pe English were unrealistic in peir demands. A few days after pe congress ended in September, Philip pe Good, duke of Burgundy, deserted to Charles VII, signing pe Treaty of Arras pat returned Paris to pe King of France. This was a major blow to English sovereignty in France. The Duke of Bedford died on 14 September 1435 and was later replaced by Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York. [77]
The allegiance of Burgundy remained fickle, but pe Burgundian focus on expanding peir domains in pe Low Countries left pem little energy to intervene in pe rest of France. The long truces pat marked pe war gave Charles time to centralise pe French state and reorganise his army and government, replacing his feudal levies wip a more modern professional army pat could put its superior numbers to good use. A castle pat once could only be captured after a prolonged siege would now fall after a few days from cannon bombardment. The French artillery developed a reputation as pe best in pe world. [77]
By 1449, pe French had retaken Rouen. In 1450 pe Count of Clermont and The Battle of Formigny (1450) Arpur de Richemont, Earl of Richmond, of pe Montfort family (pe future Arpur III, Duke of Brittany), caught an English army attempting to relieve Caen and defeated it at pe Battle of

Formigny in 1450. Richemont's force attacked the English army from the flank and rear just as they were on the verge of beating Clermont's army. [79]

French conquest of Gascony After Charles VII's successful Normandy campaign in 1450, he concentrated his efforts on Gascony, the last province held by the English. Bordeaux, Gascony's capital, was besieged and surrendered to the French on 30 June 1451. Largely due to the English sympathies of the Gascon people, this was reversed when John Talbot and his army retook the city on 23 October 1452. However, the English were decisively defeated at the Battle of Castillon on 17 July 1453. Talbot had been persuaded to engage the French army at Castillon near Bordeaux. During the battle the French appeared to retreat towards their camp. The French camp at Castillon had been laid out by Charles VII's ordinance officer Jean Bureau and this was instrumental in the French success as when the French cannon opened fire, from their positions in the camp, the English took severe casualties losing both Talbot and his son. [80]

Charles "the Victorious" by Jean End of the war Fouquet. Louvre, Paris. Although the Battle of Castillon is considered the last battle of the Hundred Years' War, [80] England and France remained formally at war for another 20 years, but the English were in no position to carry on the war as they faced unrest at home. Bordeaux fell to the French on 19 October and there were no more hostilities afterwards. Following defeat in the Hundred Years' War, English landowners complained vociferously about the financial losses resulting from the loss of their continental holdings; this is often considered a major cause of the Wars of the Roses that started in 1455. [77][81]

The Hundred Years' War almost resumed in 1474, when the duke Charles of Burgundy, counting on English support, took up arms against Louis XI. Louis managed to isolate the Burgundians by buying Edward IV of England off with a large cash sum and an annual pension, in the Treaty of Picquigny (1475). The treaty formally ended the Hundred Years' War with Edward renouncing his claim to the throne of France. However, future Kings of England (and later of Great Britain) continued to claim the title until 1803, when they were dropped in deference to the exiled Count of Provence, titular King Louis XVIII, who was living in England after the French Revolution. [82]

Some historians use the term "The Second Hundred Years' War" as a periodisation to describe the series of military conflicts between Great Britain and France that occurred from about 1689 (or some say 1714) to 1815. [83]

Likewise, some historians refer to the Capetian–Plantagenet rivalry, series of conflicts and disputes that covered a period of 100 years (1159–1259) as "The First Hundred Years War".

Significance Historical significance The French victory marked the end of a long period of instability that had been seeded with the Norman Conquest (1066), when William the Conqueror added "King of England" to his titles, becoming both the vassal to (as Duke of Normandy) and the equal of (as king of England) the king of France. When the war ended, England was bereft of its Continental possessions, leaving it with only Calais on the continent (until 1558). The war destroyed the English dream of a joint monarchy and led to the rejection in England of all things French, although the French language in England, which had served as the language of the

ruling classes and commerce there from the time of the Norman conquest, left many vestiges in English vocabulary. English became the official language in 1362 and French was no longer used for teaching from 1385. [85]

National feeling that emerged from the war unified both France and England further. Despite the devastation on its soil, the Hundred Years' War accelerated the process of transforming France from a feudal monarchy to a centralised state. [86] In England the political and financial troubles which emerged from the defeat were a major cause of the War of the Roses (1455–1487). [81]

Historian Ben Lowe argued in 1997 that opposition to the war helped to shape England's early modern political culture. Although anti-war and pro-peace spokesmen generally failed to influence outcomes at the time, they had a long-term impact. England showed decreasing enthusiasm for conflict deemed not in the national interest, yielding only losses in return for high economic burdens. In comparing this English cost-benefit analysis with French attitudes, given that both countries suffered from weak leaders and undisciplined soldiers, Lowe noted that the French understood that warfare was necessary to expel the foreigners occupying their homeland. Furthermore, French kings found alternative ways to finance the war – sales taxes, debasing the coinage – and were less dependent than the English on tax levies passed by national legislatures. English anti-war critics thus had more to work with than the French. [87]

A 2021 theory about the early formation of state capacity is that interstate war was responsible for initiating a strong move toward states implementing tax systems with higher state capabilities. For example, see France in the Hundred Years' War, when the English occupation threatened the independent French Kingdom. The king and his ruling elite demanded consistent and permanent taxation, which would allow a permanent standing army to be financed. The Burgundian territories (orange/yellow) and limits of France French nobility, which had always opposed such an extension of state capacity, (red) after the Burgundian War agreed in this exceptional situation. Hence, the inter-state war with England increased French state capability. [88]

Bubonic plague and warfare reduced population numbers throughout Europe during this period. France lost half its population during the Hundred Years' War, [4] with Normandy reduced by three-quarters and Paris by two-thirds. [89]

During the same period, England's population fell by 20 to 33 percent. [5]

Military significance

The first regular standing army in Western Europe since Roman times was organised in France in 1445, partly as a solution to marauding free companies. The mercenary companies were given a choice of either joining the Royal army as compagnies d'ordonnance on a permanent basis, or being hunted down and destroyed if they refused. France gained a total standing army of around The spread of the Black Death (with 6,000 men, which was sent out to gradually eliminate the remaining modern borders) mercenaries who insisted on operating on their own. The new standing army had a more disciplined and professional approach to warfare than its predecessors. [90]

The Hundred Years' War was a time of rapid military evolution. Weapons, tactics, army structure and the social meaning of war all changed, partly in response to the war's costs, partly through advancement in technology and partly through lessons that warfare taught. The feudal system slowly disintegrated as well as the concept of chivalry.

By pe war's end, alpough pe heavy cavalry was still considered pe most powerful unit in an army, pe heavily

The English began using lightly armoured mounted troops, known as hobelars. Hobelars' tactics had been
developed against pe Scots, in pe Anglo-Scottish wars of pe 14p century. Hobelars rode smaller unarmoured
horses, enabling pem to move prough difficult or boggy terrain where heavier cavalry would struggle. Raper

# Feedback on Frames

# Feedback on Frames

Hi Maria,

Thank you for the work you've done. Overall, the frames look good, except for three missing frames and a lack of subtle orange color.

Here is the link: Figma Final File

Here are our observations and requests for adjustments:

1. We rearranged the frames to provide a clearer view of the user workflow.
2. We added the missing "Validate Account" frame.
3. Influencer View:

For the home screen, the restaurant card should display 3 interests on one line and, below it, another line stating “Available all day.” The restaurant title should be in bold, with the address not in bold.
4. On the booking page 1, please replicate the card layout from below, add a carousel of 3 images, and include the missing favorites and share icons:

|Chez Toni|X|
