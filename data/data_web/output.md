This is especially true when it comes to Ferrari drivers, with the team's youngest driver Charles Leclerc regularly winning the hearts of fans throughout the Formula 1 paddock one wink at a time. {title} {duration} While some fans may have been hoping to join the race for the Monegasque driver's heart, Leclerc recently confirmed to Gala France that he is officially off the market. As the beloved Tifosi get ready to cheer Ferrari towards their next grand prix podium, we take a closer look at Charles Leclerc's relationship history. Getty Alexandra Saint Mleux Charles Leclerc's current girlfriend is 21-year-old Alexandra Saint Mleux. Rumours of Charles and Alexandra's relationship first began to surface on TikTok in March 2023 following the comments of some eagle-eyed fans who believed that Mleux was briefly in the background of a video of Leclerc at Paris Fashion Week. Speculation surrounding the potential new paddock romance reached its peak in May 2023 when Alexandra was spotted attending the Monaco Formula 1 Grand Prix as a guest of Leclerc's team Ferrari. The rumours appeared to be confirmed following Sunday's race, with Charles and Alexandra pictured hand in hand at a number of after-parties. This was further confirmed during Leclerc's Monaco Grand Prix press tour, with the 26-year-old confirming to Gala France that he was in a relationship. The couple's first public outing was at the 2023 Wimbledon Tennis Tournament, where the couple were photographed sharing an affectionate moment alongside fellow Formula 1 driver Pierre Gasly and Kika Gomez. While the couple has not yet spoken about their relationship, it appears that Alexandra is already being warmly welcomed into the Leclerc family, with the couple recently spotted on a family holiday alongside Charles' brothers, Arthur and Lorenzo, and their girlfriends. Getty Charlotte Sine Leclerc was previously in a long-term relationship with Monegasque architecture student Charlotte Sine, with the couple dating from 2019 to December 2022. According to The Sun, the couple first met when they were teenagers, with Charlotte and Charles being frequently spotted with the same friendship group throughout their relationship. Both Charles and Charlotte frequently shared adorable posts of their adventures together to Instagram which quickly cemented the couple as one of the most loved romances amongst Formula 1 fans. Charlotte was also frequently spotted throughout the paddock on Grand Prix weekends, with her final appearance at Abu Dhabi's Yas Marina Circuit occurring less than one month before the couple announced their split. "Hello everyone. Charlotte and I have decided to end our relationship and we remain good friends. We have shared so many great moments and she is and always will be a very special person to me. She is amazing and deserves the best," Leclerc shared to Instagram in December 2022. Getty Giada Gianni Before entering the world of Formula 1, Charles Leclerc was in a long-term relationship with Italian model Giada Gianni. The couple first got together in 2015 during Charles' season in Formula 3. Although there is very little known about the pair's romance, Giada did comment on the couple's split during an appearance on her Instagram Live in 2019. "Charles left me. He wants to devote himself only to Ferrari," she told her followers, with the timing of the couple's breakup coinciding with Leclerc's move from the Alfa Romeo Sauber Formula 1 team to Ferrari.
